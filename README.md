# Features
User authentication (Login/Logout/Register)
Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) blog posts
Dynamic content rendering using Django templates
Admin panel for blog management
Comment system for blog posts
Responsive design


# Technologies Used
Django: Python-based web framework for backend development
SQLite: Database for data persistence
HTML/CSS: Frontend styling
Bootstrap: For responsive design
